# Skill: Spec-Driven Development

## Purpose
Ensure all development strictly follows written specifications.
Prevent assumptions, hallucinations, and undocumented features.

## Core Rules
- NEVER write code without a relevant specification.
- If a requirement is unclear or missing, STOP and ask for clarification.
- Do not invent features, fields, or behaviors.
- Implementation must match specs exactly.

## Workflow
1. Read all referenced spec files.
2. Identify requirements and constraints.
3. Validate that specs are complete.
4. Implement only what is explicitly defined.
5. Reject requests that bypass specs.

## Prohibited Behavior
- Guessing requirements
- Adding "nice-to-have" features
- Refactoring beyond spec scope

## Mindset
"Specs are contracts. Contracts are law."
